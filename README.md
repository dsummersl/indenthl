NOTE
====

I recommend you try [vim-indent-guides](https://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides) instead.

Overview
====

A simple syntax coloring script you can use to augment existing syntaxes with
to include highlighting of each indent level with a different color. 

See http://viming.blogspot.com/2007/02/indent-level-highlighting.html for
screenshots.

This plugin only works in GUI mode, but you can use it with the CSApprox
plugin in console mode.
